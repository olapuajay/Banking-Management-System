The Banking Management System is a software application designed to replicate core banking operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, deposit and withdrawal of
funds, and money transfer. This project focuses on developing an efficient, secure, and accurate banking system that can manage multiple accounts, handle transactions,
and ensure data integrity using appropriate data structures and algorithms.

Features of the System:

1. Account Management:
   - Account Creation: Allows users to create a new bank account by entering personal details (e.g., name, account number, and initial deposit).
   - Account Deletion: Provides the option to remove an account from the system if it is no longer needed.
   - Account Lookup: Enables users to search for their account details using their account number.

2. Transactions:
   - Deposit Funds: Allows users to deposit money into their account, increasing their account balance.
   - Withdraw Funds: Enables users to withdraw money from their account, provided they have sufficient balance.
   - Balance Inquiry: Provides users with the ability to check their current account balance at any time.
   - Money Transfer: Facilitates the transfer of funds from one account to another.

3. Transaction Handling:
   - Manages the transaction history for each account, ensuring that deposits, withdrawals, and transfers are properly logged and processed.
   - Ensures that all transactions are secure and accurately reflected in the account balance.

4. Error Handling and Data Integrity:
   - Validates inputs (e.g., checking sufficient balance before withdrawal, preventing transfers to non-existent accounts).
   - Handles errors such as invalid account numbers, incorrect transaction amounts, and exceeding available balance limits.

5. Reporting:
   - Provides a summary of banking operations, such as the total number of accounts and overall account balances.
   - Enables users to generate reports of their transaction history.

Data Structures and Algorithms:

- Array/List: Used to store account details such as the account number, account holder's name, and current balance.
- Sorting Algorithms: Sorting techniques such as merge sort or quicksort are used to organize account data (e.g., by account number).
- Search Algorithms: Binary search or linear search algorithms are implemented for fast account lookup using account numbers.
- Queues/Stacks: Used for handling transaction histories or managing the order of transactions in the system.
- Error Handling: Ensures that invalid transactions (e.g., insufficient balance or incorrect account details) are detected and managed appropriately.

Technology Stack:
- Language: C++
- Data Structures: Arrays or lists for managing accounts and transactions, queues or stacks for transaction handling.
- Algorithms: Sorting and searching algorithms for efficient data management and account operations.

Real-World Applications:

1. Personal Use: This system can be used by individuals to manage their bank accounts, check balances, and handle personal transactions from the comfort of their home.
   
2. E-Commerce Platforms: The banking system can be implemented to handle secure payments and online purchases for customers on e-commerce websites.

3. Financial Institutions: Banks and financial institutions can use this system to provide their customers with a simplified interface for account management and secure transaction handling.

Challenges and Solutions:

- Transaction Security: To ensure secure transaction handling, robust error-checking mechanisms are used, preventing unauthorized access or operations on accounts.
- Data Integrity: Data integrity is maintained through proper input validation, ensuring that account balances and transactions are accurately processed.
- Efficient Search: By using binary search or similar algorithms, account lookup is optimized for fast access, even with a large number of accounts.

Conclusion:
The Banking Management System provides a reliable, secure, and efficient way to manage core banking operations. It simplifies account management,
enables fast and secure transactions, and provides useful reports for both users and banks. With the use of optimized algorithms and data structures,
the system ensures quick response times and secure transaction handling, making it a valuable tool for both personal banking and large-scale financial institutions.
